next work for kernel:
    - getting the screen to handle backspace/etc. appropriately
      (basically an echo terminal.)
    - move a bit of stuff out of “kernel.c”

steps after (in no particular order):
    - filesystem
    - processes + PIT; threading
    - virtual memory
    - networking
    - libc (to compile a small C compiler + programs written for Linux, hopefully!)
    - testing on real 64bit hardware, like a laptop.
    - vi text editor

done:
    ✓ getting all the keys to work
    ✓ document everything that's happened so far, and what I learned
